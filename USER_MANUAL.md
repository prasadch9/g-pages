verified: false
```

### Track listing status

The business dashboard shows:

- Total listings.
- Approved listings.
- Pending listings.
- Rejected listings.
- Views.
- Favorites.
- Rejection reason when provided.

### Understand approval results

#### Approved

The listing becomes publicly visible and searchable. Its status changes to `approved` and it is marked verified.

#### Rejected

The listing remains hidden from public discovery. The rejection reason appears in the business dashboard and a notification is created.

#### Editing after approval

When owner editing is implemented through the update endpoint, owner changes return the listing to pending review so the admin can verify the updated information again.

## 5. Administrator account

### Admin account setup

Public registration cannot create an admin role. The admin account must be created through the seed configuration or promoted directly in MongoDB.

Development seed configuration:

```env
SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@googlepages.local
SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin@12345
SEED_ADMIN_MOBILE=9999999999
```

Run:

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

Use a new secure password in any shared or production environment.

### Login as administrator

1. Open **Log in**.
2. Enter the admin email or mobile number.
3. Enter the admin password.
4. The application redirects the admin to `/admin`.

If the page says **Access restricted**, the account returned by the API is not currently using `role: "admin"`. Log out, confirm the MongoDB role, and log in again.

### Admin overview

The overview displays platform information such as:

- Total users.
- Business owners.
- Total listings.
- Approved listings.
- Pending listings.
- Categories.
- Cities.
- Reviews.
- Enquiries.
- Most viewed listings.
- Most searched listings.

### Review submitted listings

1. Open `/admin`.
2. Select **Businesses**.
3. Open the **Pending** tab.
4. Review the listing name, category, city, owner, email, and address.

### Approve a listing

1. Locate a pending listing.
2. Select **Approve**.
3. The listing changes to `approved`.
4. The listing is marked verified.
5. The listing becomes publicly visible.
6. The owner receives an in-app approval notification.

### Reject a listing

1. Locate a pending listing.
2. Select **Reject**.
3. Enter a clear rejection reason.
4. Select **Confirm**.
5. The listing changes to `rejected`.
6. The owner receives the rejection reason and notification.

### Suspend an approved listing

The backend supports suspending a listing. A suspended listing is hidden from public discovery and can be managed from the administrator workflow.

### Manage users

1. Open **Users** in the admin console.
2. Search by name, email, or mobile number.
3. Block or unblock an account.
4. Change roles through the admin action when required.
5. Delete an account only when necessary because deletion is destructive.

### Import place data

1. Open **Businesses** in the admin console.
2. Use the **Import places** panel.
3. Upload a JSON or CSV file.
4. Use the downloadable template for the expected columns.
5. Select **Upload to MongoDB**.
6. Review the import result message.

Required fields:

```text
name, category, state, district, city, address
```

Optional fields include:

```text
area, description, phone, website, images, services, rating, reviewCount
```

Use the pipe character to separate multiple image or service values:

```text
images=image-one-url|image-two-url
services=Delivery|Online enquiries|Customer support
```

## 6. Role troubleshooting

### Access restricted after admin login

Check the following:

1. The account exists in MongoDB.
2. The account has exactly `role: "admin"`.
3. The account status is `active`.
4. You logged out and logged in again after changing the role.
5. The frontend is connected to the correct backend through `VITE_API_URL`.
6. The backend was restarted after environment changes.

### Business dashboard is restricted

The account must have exactly `role: "business"`. Selecting “I own a business” during registration creates this role for new accounts.

### Listing does not appear publicly

Check that:

- The listing was approved by an admin.
- Its status is `approved`.
- Its category and city are correct.
- The frontend is connected to the same MongoDB database where the listing was created.

### No seeded data appears

Check that `MONGO_URI` exists in `server/.env`, then run:

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

## 7. Operational rules summary
